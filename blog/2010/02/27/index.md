> «Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.»

> «Premature optimization is the root of all evil.»

> «Languages shape the way we think, or don't.»

> -- Erik Naggum

> «Einstein argued that there must be simplified explanations of nature, because God is not capricious or arbitrary. No such faith comforts the software engineer.»
>
> -- Fred Brooks

> «[1949] As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.»
>
> -- Maurice Wilkes

> «If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.»
>
> -- E. W. Dijkstra

> «On two occasions I have been asked, -- 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.»
>
> -- Charles Babbage

> «Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.»
>
> -- Rich Cook

> «No matter how slick the demo is in rehearsal, when you do it in front of a live audience, the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching, raised to the power of the amount of money involved.»
>
> -- Mark Gibbs

> «A computer program does what you tell it to do, not what you want it to do.»

> «I'm taking a break from programming and trying to escape the world of geekness, and then Winamp brings up 'Norah Jones -- Pointer Song'. *God damn it, leave me alone!*»

> «There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.»
>
> -- C. A. R. Hoare

> «Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need, it's almost certainly over-designed. And don't expect people to jump in and help you. That's not how these things work. You need to get something half-way *useful* first, and then others will say 'hey, that *almost* works for me', and they'll get involved in the project.»

> -- Linus Torvalds

> «Hofstadter's Law: it always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.»

> «One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.»

> -- Ken Thompson

> «Some people, when confronted with a problem, think 'I know, I'll use regular expressions.' Now they have two problems.»
>
> -- Jamie Zawinski

> «It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a `DestroyBaghdad` procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a `DestroyCity` procedure, to which `Baghdad` could be given as a parameter.»
>
> -- Nathaniel Borenstein

> «The problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana, but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.»
>
> -- Joe Armstrong

> «Screwed-up initial design together with endless reinvention is why IT is such a disaster. C not good enough for you? Let's have C++, or this other version of C++, or this one. No, let's reimplement in Java. Or C#. Or Python. Perl. Ruby. SGML no good? ... Just reinvent everything once again, use XML (it must work, it's so big and complicated by now -- how can anything that big not work), and we'll all get rich this time. Right. Sure. I'll just do something else, if you don't mind.»
>
> -- Tim Bradshav

> «I have actually programmed a fair bit in Perl, like I have C++ code published with my name on it. Other things I have tried and have no intention to do again if I can at all avoid it include smoking, getting drunk enough to puke and waste the whole next day with hang-over, breaking a leg in a violent car crash, getting mugged in New York City, and travel with Aeroflot.»
