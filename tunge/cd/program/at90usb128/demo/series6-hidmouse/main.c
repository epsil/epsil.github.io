//!
//! @section intro License
//! This software uses code written by Atmel Corporation. Use of that code is
//! subject to Atmel's End User License Agreement, \ref lic_page.
//! This license does not apply to sensors.c and sensors.h.
//!
//! @section install Description
//! This embedded application source code illustrates how to implement a HID mouse application
//! over the AT90USBKey controller, reading from resistive sensors connected to ports P1,
//! P2, P4, P5, P6 and P7.
//!
//! @section arch Architecture
//! As illustrated in the figure bellow, the application entry point is located is the main.c file.
//! The main function first performs the initialization of a scheduler module and then runs it in an infinite loop.
//! The scheduler is a simple infinite loop calling all its tasks defined in the conf_scheduler.h file.
//! No real time schedule is performed, when a task ends, the scheduler calls the next task defined in
//! the configuration file (conf_scheduler.h).
//!
//! The sample dual role application is based on two different tasks:
//! - The usb_task  (usb_task.c associated source file), is the task performing the USB low level
//! enumeration process in device mode.
//! - The mouse task performs mouse events decoding and report construction to the USB host.
//!
//! The mouse task is contained in the files mouse_task.c and sensors.c. The latter contains
//! all sensor code.
